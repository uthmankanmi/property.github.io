								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As with every other investment, real estate investment has its ups and down such as falling scam or not getting the right documents for a property. Real estate investment is considered the least risky and the most lucrative investments in the world. However, it is as well lucrative for fake agents to play on people&#8217;s intelligent and scam them of their hard earned wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buying a property is considered an expensive investment and careful checks need to be put in place to avoid falling victims of real estate scams. In this article, I will share 5 most common real estate scams and how to easily avoid them.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Online Property Scam</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is often the most common form of real estate scam in recent times. Rental or sales property is advertised at a very low cost that keeps you wondering if the property actually exists. Most of these Ads consist of randomly downloaded pictures from other verified real estate website and common property description just to make someone fall for the scam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this type of real estate scam, the fake agents or scammers will always avoid contact with the prospective tenants or buyers until it&#8217;s time to close the lead, they delay calls, postpone sending more details about the property and often times request they meet off-site to discuss the property as against meeting at the actual property.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the little or no entry barrier and the absence of strong regulations as to who can deal with real estate investments, individuals buyers or renters are advised to watch out for this type of scam when dealing in real estate.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Title Fraud</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Title fraud is another common real estate scam everywhere around the world, particularly with sales property. This is a situation whereby an agent tries to convince a property buyer that a property has a certificate of occupancy title when it doesn&#8217;t even have a Governor&#8217;s consent title. It is the hardest form of real estate scam to be broken by just anybody due to its level of complication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Properties come with different titles which indicate their level of insurance as it relates to the government&#8217;s approval for use. If you chose to buy a property yourself, the best route to protect yourself against this type of scam is to hire a real estate agent that understands the nitty-gritty of the business and has a wide network of other professionals in the industry to verify the land title on your behalf.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Home Improvement Scams</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a situation whereby a group of people approaches a homeowner to offer home improvement services that will enhance the value of their property should they be interested in selling. They most times use high-pressure sales tactics that leave you wondering if it&#8217;s actually worth the investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, they may promise to fix your bathroom, kitchen wares with imported leftover materials from a previous construction job and request for commitment pay or they take their offer to someone else. It is advised that every point of your real estate investment, ensure you deal with the registered company with a verifiable presence both offline and online as this will reduce the level of risk you may encounter.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Property Investment Seminars and Conference</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As funny as this may sound, real estate scams can also come in forms of seminars and property investment courses. It is actually a great move if you consider attending real estate seminars or courses be it a free or paid program.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, real estate scammers take advantage of this seminar to hook individuals into an unstructured real estate investment that makes your money work on its own (is that even possible), it is most times combined of a motivational speaker, a millionaire you know nothing about and an investment expert with no certification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some can go as far as charging money for the seminars, coerce attendees into buying their books and often lure people into buying their property investment or get a loan from their partner financial institutions. Check this link for verified real estate seminars and courses you can attend for free.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Overrated Investment Potential</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be it offline or online, real estate professionals are known to market the value of a property to get anyone into buying the property. This is often predominant in a fast developing neighborhood where there is a forecast growth for real estate investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take your time to request for inspection, ensure you see clear recent pictures and maybe a video of the property if you can&#8217;t go for a physical inspection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do your assignment, research about the neighborhood online, talk to friends about it and hire a trusted real estate agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The above-listed are some of the real estate scams you may encounter in your dealing, there are several others we can&#8217;t cover in this article. But remember, hiring a real estate agent to handle this dealing saves your quality time, effort and more importantly, protect you from real estate scams.</p>
