								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with a real estate agent can become a difficult decision to make if you have little or no experience as to what is expected of you in dealing with the real estate agent. <span style="letter-spacing: 0.45px;">An average real estate investor is more concerned about how much they tend to gain from the investment, neglecting every other aspect of the agent&#8217;s capa</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.03em;">bility to handle their project.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, there are currently no means by which you can tell genuine real estate agents from fraudulent ones. You can easily avoid losing your hard earned money to incompetent and heartless real estate agents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have compiled some critical questions you should ask any real estate agents you want to work with. Below are 5 important questions to ask a real estate agent.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Agent Years Of Experience</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An experience they say is the best teacher, the same applies to deal with real estate agents as well. Endeavor to ask the real estate agents how long they&#8217;ve been in business. This is more important if the agents will be selling luxurious properties in high-end locations such as Lekki, Lagos.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Available Property Listings</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Checking the agent&#8217;s listings will give you insight into the kind of properties they can handle and whether or not to move on with the discussion. Professional real estate agents regularly update their website and social media with their recent listings.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Ask For Reviews</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This sounds more like a direct question to get to know some of the agent&#8217;s clients and their thought about his delivery. Find a way to look through some of their past clients and ask some questions about the real estate agent as well.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Ask About Pricing</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asking the agent about pricing will provide you with more information as to how knowledgeable they are in the real estate industry and more particular, their understanding of the local market.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Ask About Their Timing</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You wouldn&#8217;t want to work with an agent that takes forever to sell or find you a property, probably because they don&#8217;t have the property they claim to have. If the agents can be specific as to when they can get you your desired properties or similar variations just go ahead and look for someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is advised that you treat your first meeting with the real estate agents more like an interview and an opportunity to get all of the details on all that is required to do business with them.</p>
