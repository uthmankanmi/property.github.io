								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Real estate investment comes with ups and downs and mistakes that often influences decision making. As much as there are lots of information on the internet on how to successfully invest in real estate, little is being shared on how to avoid the common mistakes in real estate investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Investing in real estate requires some level of good understanding of the industry, process, and regulations that influence investment decisions in real estate. There is little or no entry barrier for real estate investment but real estate investment sometimes might be a bit challenging.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article, I will be sharing 5 common real estate mistakes and how to easily avoid these mistakes when investing your money.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Not Having a Financial Plan</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Becoming a successful real estate investor goes beyond having millions of Naira to play within your account. Take into account your financial status and your budget constraints. There is a probability of 95% failure if you risk planning your budget before you make a real estate investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To begin with, plan a reasonable budget for your real estate investment based on the available information from professional real estate agents or industry experts. Endeavor to stick to your budgets when checking out real estate offers you are interested in before you make a serious decision.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Not Making Proper Research</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Proper and adequate research is the bedrock of every real estate investment decisions. If you don&#8217;t have a very good knowledge of the real estate industry. you can do a quick online search about some factors such as the location, development plans or alternatively outsource the task to a real estate agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The research process includes getting more details about the particular property, and regulations concerning property usage. You can easily avoid this mistake by allocating time to research all potential properties before making investment decisions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Neglecting Laws and Regulations</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most painful experience someone may ever experience in their lifetime is watching their own property get demolished for neglection the rules and regulations that bind property investment. Every investment has its regulations, laws, and guidelines that should be strictly adhered to in other to ensure a hassle-free investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is advisable to take into consideration all the tax regulations, housing laws, and property regulations to avoid irreplaceable disaster with your real estate investment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Not Hiring Professionals</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If not egos, we all have that feeling which makes us believe we can easily get things done by ourselves. Whether or not this is true of everyone, it doesn&#8217;t apply to real estate investment. Not only is a real estate investment expensive, but it&#8217;s also highly competitive and as such needs expertise to make the right decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you start throwing money out there trying to fix the least important thing first, consider hiring a professional real estate agent that will walk you through all the process such as searching, negotiation, and paperwork.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Not Having a Goal</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most investors fall the victims of just investing because there is a property for sale. Real estate is not a get rich quick scheme and shouldn&#8217;t be portrayed as one. There is a huge difference between the price of property maintenance, renovation costs and much more before you can put a property for sale at a reasonable price. After setting a realistic goal as to what you would like to achieve with your real estate investment, it is important to discuss your goals with real estate experts to validate your process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is advised to ask every question possible and avoid being unrealistic with your set goals as well as your budget planning.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">With over 100 real estate agents in Lagos only, selecting a real estate to work with can be sometimes overwhelming especially if you are new at it. Choosing the less qualified agents can be a great blow at ruining your real estate investments which can probably lead to unpleasant experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Real estate agents are popularly known for their unique skills, level of success in dealing with properties in different locations and several years of experience in the real estate industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering some other factors that may be unknown to the general public, our <a href="https://sellerrand.com/top-5-tips-for-first-time-home-buyers/">5 steps to choosing a real estate agent</a> is a great resource for you to invest wisely.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1.Knowledge of Real Estate Industry</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Nigeria, you don&#8217;t necessarily rely on a real estate agent for having a university degree or some physical traits. It is advised to meet with the real estate agents you would be working with in person to ask some of the specific questions that will help you know more about the agent. Some of the questions should include their knowledge of the local market, their negotiation pattern, skills and more. Asking questions will help you gauge the agent&#8217;s knowledge of the area.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Referrals and Research</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real estate industry is a very big market in Nigeria, fast growing as such requires some level of trust before you can drop your hard earned possessions with just anybody. Your first point of research is to talk to your family, network of friends and probably look each agent up online. It is advised to have several agents on your list to research your review and get to know more about their credibility.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Personal Feelings</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As funny as this may sound, you will need to work with your personal intuitions too because it can go a long way in making reasonable assumptions. Real estate is a big investment and as such, you shouldn&#8217;t give out your money to someone you don&#8217;t trust. Watch out for some personality traits you might not be convenient with, do they make you feel comfortable while chatting with them? Do they maintain eye contact?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is advised you feel comfortable talking, chatting with the real estate agent before moving along with the business.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Agent Strategies and Competitive Advantages</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not all real estate agents would love to share their strategies but to some extent, they should be able to give you some level of assurance. Ask the real estate agents if they offer what other agents in the industry are yet to unleash. This will help you better understand their operations and how soon they can make sales on your properties.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Regular Reviews</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take your time to see if you can speak with some of the agents past and current clients. The ability to maintain an ongoing review with your agent will help make communications faster and enhance your agents on how committed they are too specific needs as your property sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, you might sometimes feel your agents are not doing so well as regards your property due to the local market and several other factors. Learn to follow up with the agents on periodic occasions to get updated information about the properties.</p>
