								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A survey was carried out and it was found out that 84% of people will choose a job far from their place of abode with 3% pay higher, than another close to where they live without that 3%.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That 3% pay amounts to spending several hours on the road, especially if you live in Lagos. A whole lot could be done at that time. You can&#8217;t do much work or partake in any serious activity in the time you spend on the road and in traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is very important to consider a job close to where you live because to a larger extent it affects your physical and mental health as well as work-life balance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few reasons why you should live close to your workplace:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. You save money: It is outrageous that most people spend more than half of their salaries on transport fare to work. This excludes the fact that transport fare could increase at any point in time especially during festive periods or raining season.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. It takes a toll on your health : Spending hours on the road will expose you to pollution especially in a major city like Lagos that is crowded and densely populated, picture sitting in an airtight, limited space Lagos bus and inhaling the fumes from trucks and cars, that is enough to make you depressed and frustrated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Stress: the stress is just not worth it. The distance between your workplace and your house affects your mental health and can make you get more frustrated. Residing close to your workplace gives you more time to prepare for work and reduce stress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Less motivation: you definitely will feel less motivated after going through the journey and possibly traffic before you get to work and it&#8217;s not good for your work even if you are your own employer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Accident prone: When you have to travel so far to work on a daily basis you are more prone to being involved in an accident and several other road hazards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. Reduces your productivity: Considering the hustle and struggle for a vehicle and the many other stress you may encounter on your journey, you may end up not being as productive as you should because of the stress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can decide to end all of these unnecessary stress by getting a property close to your workplace.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Property inspection if done right is one of the smartest ways of buying the right property that worths your time and money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you&#8217;ve been in the real estate for years or you are just setting out to buy your first home, don&#8217;t underestimate the benefits of home inspection. Going for inspection gives you a great avenue to see and know every little detail about the property you intend to buy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this blog article, we&#8217;ve put together the critical things you should watch out for during property inspection. It is advised that you pay close attention to every part of these inspection process to avoid problems.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Roof</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The roof is one of the most important features of a house and it should never be overlooked during an inspection. If you have the strength, you might ask for a ladder and climb the rooftop to see things for yourself. The roof is a major player in keeping the home interior in good shape and considered to be one of the most expensive parts of the house to renovate or replace.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Water Drainage System</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another issue when it comes to property inspection is to look out for how water flows in and out of the building. Check the gutters and home vicinity to confirm if water outside the building flows away from the house and not towards the building. Take note of the walls too for how water from the rooftop is being disbursed around the building.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Electrical fittings</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The electrical system of the home is another important part that needs close attention. Modern homes now make use of a conduit wiring system where the cables are underground or inside the wall. Check the circuit breakers and test some of the sockets in the bedroom, sitting room, kitchen and get them fixed if there is an issue.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Floor Quality or Tiles</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Nigeria for example, most homes are made of tile floors unlike other parts of the world where home builders make use of wood, glass and several other types of flooring. For a tiled floor, ensure you check the joint, the tiles on the side, take a closer look at the proportion and walk on it like you own the property already to identify cracks.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Wall Painting</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to the flooring is also the painting of the house, run your hand through the walls to notice peeling paints, check if the outside wall is close to drainage that may damage the wall and weaken the home. It is recommended that you pour water on the building if the inspection office permits that.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">6. Plumbing Work</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paying close attention to the plumbing system of the home gives you an opportunity to see the water pressure and lots more in action. Ensure the bathtubs, showers, sinks are leak tested during an inspection, you wouldn&#8217;t want to pay for a home where bathroom water can flow through your bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, it is advised that you ask as many questions as you may have during the inspection because it will give you more understanding into some of the workings of the home judging from the real estate agent&#8217;s knowledge. Some of the fixes you noted down in your inspection report could be easily fixed if you decide to talk to the agent&#8217;s about it rather than making assumptions or ended up with an apartment you will regret.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
Real estate industry is big enough for everyone to get in there but not everyone can comfortably make it to the top. The desire to achieve success in your dealings as a real estate agent is one thing and the ability to understand the actions involved in making your desired success a reality is another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you wonder how some real estate agents in Nigeria became an icon?<br />
Find below some important habits you should work on towards becoming a successful real estate agent in Nigeria.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Have a Plan</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the real estate industry is so big enough to make you wallow in the dark but having a strong plan will enable you to stand true to your niche. Most of the failures in every real estate deal are as a result of failed plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ensure you master a category of the real estate market you are comfortable with, make the necessary connections that will help you grow in your desired niche and carefully draw a plan that works best for different situations.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Embrace Technology</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The essence of technology as it relates to the successful growth of a real estate business cannot be overemphasized in this digital age. Employing digital tools will make it much easier for you to reach your target market and maximize profits.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Be Proactive</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using a proactive approach in the real estate market is a proven way to achieve success faster. By being proactive in your actions as a real estate agent, you tend to pay more attention to doing things that matter to your business towards generating leads and building a sustainable business model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Proactive real estate agents don&#8217;t just get leads, they make it a priority to respond to these leads and convert them faster.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Employ Digital Marketing</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Advertising your business online is one of the first approaches towards attaining success as a real estate agent. As a real estate agent, employing the necessary digital marketing strategies makes it easy for you to reach individuals and companies that may need your services. You can liaise with brands that have an online presence via their websites and social media for wider reach.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Learn More</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Real estate is an ever-growing industry and as such requires you as a real estate agent to always learn the newest and best ways to grow your business. Make it a top priority to keep up with the industry trends, read books and attend professional seminars that will help you grow your expertise. Learning more about the real estate market will keep you ahead of your competitors and others in the real estate industry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Real estate investment across the world is dependent upon location as it determines the value of a real estate property. Investing in real estate in Nigeria has become a lot easier through the establishment of registered and verifiable real estate companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ibeju Lekki being one of the most sought after location for real estate investment in Nigeria. The first set of real estate investors who bought into the old Maroko are now earning big from their real estate investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with another metropolis in Lagos, the rate of development projects in Lekki can&#8217;t be compared to any and in this article, I will share some major reasons why you should invest in Ibeju Lekki real estate.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Lekki Free Trade Zone</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lekki Free Trade Zone is a dedicated development facility which covers a total area of about 805 hectares of land in Ibeju Lekki. Lekki Free Trade Zone will provide an ideal platform to open up the diverse market for all investors and enterprises in the world making it a unique landmark of the future development of Lagos state and Nigeria as a whole. The project is divided into north and south and upon completion is expected to accommodate 120,000 people for residential purposes on the north part while the south part of Lekki Free Trade Zone is restricted for commercial purposes.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Lekki International Airport</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lekki International Airport is another great project set to be established within the Lekki Free Trade Zone. Although, there are lots of conversations as to the airport project in Lekki it sure has a lot of advantages on real estate investment in Ibeju Lekki.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Fourth Mainland Bridge</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lagos state is the fastest and most popular business hub in Nigeria, which is one of the reasons for the overwhelming population in Lagos state. The 4th Mainland bridge is a proposed 3km bridge that will connect Lagos mainland to the Island from Ajah axis to Ikorodu hereby reducing the rate of traffic congestion and making life a whole lot easier for residents. Real estate investment for both residential and commercial purposes in the Ibeju Lekki axis will definitely benefit a lot from the project.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Lekki Deep Sea Port</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As included in the Federal Government Economic Recovery and Growth plan is the establishment of a Seaport in Lagos state including Ondo, Ogun, Delta, Akwa Ibom, and Bayelsa. The project is set to be situated in Ibeju Lekki axis and its establishment will boost the development of real estate investments, create more jobs and grow the Nigerian economy through imports and exports.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Developmental Growth</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lagos being one of the fastest growing regions across Africa has become a major concentration point for different types of businesses cutting across restaurants, hospitality, health, recreational and lots others. The monumental boost in the Ibeju Lekki axis will be of a major development to real estate investment for both residential and commercial purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The above listed are some of the reasons why <a href="https://sellerrand.com/projects/">real estate investment</a> in Lekki is the best you can get in Nigeria.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In a country like Nigeria, the major measurements of lands are Hectares, Acres, Feet, and Meters. As a new or existing investor in real estate, the ability to master these types of measurements will help make informed decisions about the size and measurements of land you should know.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Land division in Nigeria, the desired plot for house construction is 100 x 50ft. A hectare is a land measuring 328ft x 328ft or 100m x 100m which is about two and a half acres of Land. Acre is a rectangular plot of land with 4,046sqm or 43,560 square ft.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Plot of land is a marked out piece of land for the purpose of farming or building. The word &#8220;plot&#8221; is an arbitrary term used to describe a land division carved out for property development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of a plot can vary based on economic or societal development such as human migrations, environmental disaster, land scarcity and the availability of lands meant for development.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Square Metres (SQM)</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is often the most popular land measurement everyone is familiar with in Nigeria. A Land is measured by the square meter from 1sqm and above. A plot of land according to some real estate developers could either be 600sqm or 648sqm. However, a real estate developer can decide to use 450sqm as a residential plot and 648sqm as a commercial plot. Using square meters has become the new trend in major real estate developments across the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">600 square meter/648 square meter = 1 Plot of Land<br />
450 square meter = half &amp; quarter plot or residential 1 plot.<br />
300 square meter = Half plot.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Plot</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A popular term in the real estate industry is 60 by 120 which equally means a plot of land. According to Nigeria&#8217;s land divisions, the appropriate plot for house construction is 100 x 50ft which can conveniently accommodate a standard living house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">100 x 50ft = 1 plot.<br />
120 x 60ft = 1 plot.<br />
600sqm or 648sqm or 667sqm = 1 plot.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Acre</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Acre is another popular unit of land measurement in Nigeria. An Acre of land is a rectangular shaped 6 plots of land combined together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6 plots of land = 1 Acre.<br />
100 x 50ft in 6 places = 1 Acre.<br />
600sqm x 6 = 3600sqm (1 Acre).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Hectare</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is not a common unit of land measurement in Nigeria due to its complexity, however a hectare of land measures about 2.5 acres totaling 328 x 328ft (100m x 100m). It is the least used land measurement even within real estate developers across Nigeria.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">100m x 100m = 1 Hectare<br />
328ft x 328ft = 1 Hectare<br />
2 acres and half = 1 Hectare<br />
15 plots = 1 Hectare<br />
600sqm x 15 = 9000sqm (1 hectare)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you are investing in real estate for commercial or residential purposes, having a fair understanding of land measurement is a good preparation towards making the right decision in your real estate investment. However, the ability to master the land measurement as it should be is not too easy, hence hiring a real estate agent to work with remains the best decision.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As with every other investment, real estate investment has its ups and down such as falling scam or not getting the right documents for a property. Real estate investment is considered the least risky and the most lucrative investments in the world. However, it is as well lucrative for fake agents to play on people&#8217;s intelligent and scam them of their hard earned wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buying a property is considered an expensive investment and careful checks need to be put in place to avoid falling victims of real estate scams. In this article, I will share 5 most common real estate scams and how to easily avoid them.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Online Property Scam</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is often the most common form of real estate scam in recent times. Rental or sales property is advertised at a very low cost that keeps you wondering if the property actually exists. Most of these Ads consist of randomly downloaded pictures from other verified real estate website and common property description just to make someone fall for the scam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this type of real estate scam, the fake agents or scammers will always avoid contact with the prospective tenants or buyers until it&#8217;s time to close the lead, they delay calls, postpone sending more details about the property and often times request they meet off-site to discuss the property as against meeting at the actual property.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the little or no entry barrier and the absence of strong regulations as to who can deal with real estate investments, individuals buyers or renters are advised to watch out for this type of scam when dealing in real estate.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Title Fraud</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Title fraud is another common real estate scam everywhere around the world, particularly with sales property. This is a situation whereby an agent tries to convince a property buyer that a property has a certificate of occupancy title when it doesn&#8217;t even have a Governor&#8217;s consent title. It is the hardest form of real estate scam to be broken by just anybody due to its level of complication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Properties come with different titles which indicate their level of insurance as it relates to the government&#8217;s approval for use. If you chose to buy a property yourself, the best route to protect yourself against this type of scam is to hire a real estate agent that understands the nitty-gritty of the business and has a wide network of other professionals in the industry to verify the land title on your behalf.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Home Improvement Scams</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a situation whereby a group of people approaches a homeowner to offer home improvement services that will enhance the value of their property should they be interested in selling. They most times use high-pressure sales tactics that leave you wondering if it&#8217;s actually worth the investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, they may promise to fix your bathroom, kitchen wares with imported leftover materials from a previous construction job and request for commitment pay or they take their offer to someone else. It is advised that every point of your real estate investment, ensure you deal with the registered company with a verifiable presence both offline and online as this will reduce the level of risk you may encounter.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Property Investment Seminars and Conference</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As funny as this may sound, real estate scams can also come in forms of seminars and property investment courses. It is actually a great move if you consider attending real estate seminars or courses be it a free or paid program.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, real estate scammers take advantage of this seminar to hook individuals into an unstructured real estate investment that makes your money work on its own (is that even possible), it is most times combined of a motivational speaker, a millionaire you know nothing about and an investment expert with no certification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some can go as far as charging money for the seminars, coerce attendees into buying their books and often lure people into buying their property investment or get a loan from their partner financial institutions. Check this link for verified real estate seminars and courses you can attend for free.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Overrated Investment Potential</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be it offline or online, real estate professionals are known to market the value of a property to get anyone into buying the property. This is often predominant in a fast developing neighborhood where there is a forecast growth for real estate investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take your time to request for inspection, ensure you see clear recent pictures and maybe a video of the property if you can&#8217;t go for a physical inspection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do your assignment, research about the neighborhood online, talk to friends about it and hire a trusted real estate agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The above-listed are some of the real estate scams you may encounter in your dealing, there are several others we can&#8217;t cover in this article. But remember, hiring a real estate agent to handle this dealing saves your quality time, effort and more importantly, protect you from real estate scams.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Real estate investment comes with ups and downs and mistakes that often influences decision making. As much as there are lots of information on the internet on how to successfully invest in real estate, little is being shared on how to avoid the common mistakes in real estate investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Investing in real estate requires some level of good understanding of the industry, process, and regulations that influence investment decisions in real estate. There is little or no entry barrier for real estate investment but real estate investment sometimes might be a bit challenging.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this article, I will be sharing 5 common real estate mistakes and how to easily avoid these mistakes when investing your money.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Not Having a Financial Plan</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Becoming a successful real estate investor goes beyond having millions of Naira to play within your account. Take into account your financial status and your budget constraints. There is a probability of 95% failure if you risk planning your budget before you make a real estate investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To begin with, plan a reasonable budget for your real estate investment based on the available information from professional real estate agents or industry experts. Endeavor to stick to your budgets when checking out real estate offers you are interested in before you make a serious decision.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Not Making Proper Research</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Proper and adequate research is the bedrock of every real estate investment decisions. If you don&#8217;t have a very good knowledge of the real estate industry. you can do a quick online search about some factors such as the location, development plans or alternatively outsource the task to a real estate agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The research process includes getting more details about the particular property, and regulations concerning property usage. You can easily avoid this mistake by allocating time to research all potential properties before making investment decisions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Neglecting Laws and Regulations</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most painful experience someone may ever experience in their lifetime is watching their own property get demolished for neglection the rules and regulations that bind property investment. Every investment has its regulations, laws, and guidelines that should be strictly adhered to in other to ensure a hassle-free investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is advisable to take into consideration all the tax regulations, housing laws, and property regulations to avoid irreplaceable disaster with your real estate investment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Not Hiring Professionals</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If not egos, we all have that feeling which makes us believe we can easily get things done by ourselves. Whether or not this is true of everyone, it doesn&#8217;t apply to real estate investment. Not only is a real estate investment expensive, but it&#8217;s also highly competitive and as such needs expertise to make the right decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you start throwing money out there trying to fix the least important thing first, consider hiring a professional real estate agent that will walk you through all the process such as searching, negotiation, and paperwork.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Not Having a Goal</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most investors fall the victims of just investing because there is a property for sale. Real estate is not a get rich quick scheme and shouldn&#8217;t be portrayed as one. There is a huge difference between the price of property maintenance, renovation costs and much more before you can put a property for sale at a reasonable price. After setting a realistic goal as to what you would like to achieve with your real estate investment, it is important to discuss your goals with real estate experts to validate your process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is advised to ask every question possible and avoid being unrealistic with your set goals as well as your budget planning.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Buying a home remains one of the greatest achievement in anyone&#8217;s life. It often comes as a surprise when young people invest in real estate or own a home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owning a home is a really expensive investment especially in the peak areas such as Lagos and Abuja. With the aid of real estate property agencies, you do not need to become a Millionaire before you can successfully become a Landowner or buy your own house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most real estate property agencies have a convenient payment plan for their projects which allows you to split the payment to a monthly or per annum fee. If you are finding it difficult to own a home due to your financial standing, below are 5 great tips to owning a home without going broke.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. Research about the location</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;ve never experienced staying in a new settlement or somewhere you don&#8217;t have relatives or familiar faces. The first point of action is to research the neighborhood you want to live and what it has to offer as regards your convenience, work and other future circumstances that may arise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the time, you might end up choosing a location because it is closer to your work but there are several other factors that should be considered before you settle for a location.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. Up your saving game</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the time, people make the mistake of spending all of their savings to pay for a new house leaving them with nothing to less to furnish their new home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you can&#8217;t be consistent with your savings, it is advised to partner with a real estate firm that offers down payment plan for your choice properties. No matter how small your paycheck is, if you are not saving enough for your targets, you might have issues paying up for your new home. Most importantly, set a realistic monthly goal you can stick to or partner with friends, family or colleagues to initiate a money-saving culture.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. Avoid buying a home you can&#8217;t afford</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not that you can&#8217;t afford the home in reality but it is advised not to avoid spending everything in your bank account on buying a new home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We often get encouraged by the kind of houses that are available in the market as at when we chose to buy. If you work with a real estate agent, they can assist you to figure out the type of home that fits perfectly for your budget. Ask the real estate agents for other fees that might come up along the line.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Consider a Mortgage Plan</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Applying for a mortgage plan helps you to purchase your first home without the hassle. Mortgage plans are most of the times government led to home ownership schemes which allow individuals who are either working with the government, business owners or private employees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most mortgage plan comes with an interest rate which is fairly considerate considering the flexibility it poses. You should consider the types of plan you qualify for and the payment percentage so you don&#8217;t end up spending more than you bargained.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. Take your time</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buying a house is not a child&#8217;s play and can not be totally delegated to someone else to handle except for trusted real estate company. Whether or now you&#8217;ve been staying in the area for a long time or not, it is advised you walk around the house during the day, rush hour and even night if you have the time. This will give you the necessary information about the house that the agents may not be able to provide an even get you familiar with your new community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Follow up with people in the community and get to make friends with them while you understudy everything you need to know about the area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owning a home of your own is a really smart investment but can be fairly expensive if you don&#8217;t prepare enough or go the right path.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Buying land is a great decision that should be taken very seriously considering the expensive price of lands in choice locations and the financial gains it attracts. Before making an offer whether or not a land investment is the next thing for you, there are several questions you should ask to help make better investment decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In countries like Nigeria, buying a land seems like a big deal because of the level of complexity involved as well as the availability of genuine real estate agents to help your investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To help you make better rewarding decisions about your land investment, below are the 5 most important questions you should ask the real estate agents.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1. What are the zoning restrictions on the Land?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Zoning restrictions are popular local law that determines the kind of property structures that are allowed in a particular area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is advised that you make findings from the government authorities about the local regulations as regards land in other to avoid building structures that are not legally allowed in an area and may probably lead to the demolition of your prestigious properties.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2. How is the location?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Land location is considered to be one of the most important sayings and oldest real estate term as it involves buying of land. To avoid buying land with less or no value, it is advised you put much of your energy into making adequate research about the location of your desired property.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of buying land should be addressed at the point of purchase, whether you are buying for commercial property or residential property.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3. What is the land investment value?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not everyone buys land to resell but the most individual that buy into real estate is mainly buying because of the investment value and possible return on investment. The land is a very good investment that could yield up to 100% return on investment within a short period of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ask the real estate agent about the investment value and possible growth of the property before you buy land.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4. Why are you buying the property?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are different reasons why people chose to buy land in a particular area, it could be for investment reasons or personal residence. Endeavor to balance on your interest in why you need to buy land in a particular area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the land is closer to a tourist attraction site, it may not be a good choice for a residential property because tourist attraction sites tend to have more potentials with commercial property.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5. What is the total cost involved?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Nigeria, real estate is a big investment and requires lots of money. Make proper findings of the total cost that will be involved along the line so as to help make better decisions with your investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of land is determined by some factors such as the location, size of the land, land title and the agent&#8217;s fee.</p>
